Since this is a back-end application you will need to clone the repository to your local machine and run `npm i` to install all dependencies. Also enure MongoDB is installed and run the script `npm run seed`, found in the package.json file, to connect to your local MongoDB database and create the needed collections for the application. To start the application run the command `npm start` and then navigate to an API testing tool, like Insomnia.

Use the following endpoints with the following routes to interact with the application: 
### Users:
* `/api/users` GET route to display all users and POST route to create a new user.
* `/api/users/:userId` GET route to display a single user by id, PUT route to update a user by id, and DELETE route to delete a user by id.
### Friends:
* `/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId` POST route to add a friend and DELETE route to delete a friend.
### Thoughts:
* `/api/thoughts` GET route to display all thoughts and POST route to create a new thought.
* `/api/thoughts/:thoughtId` GET route to display a single thought by id, PUT route to update a thought by id, and DELETE route to delete a thought by id.
### Reactions:
* `/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions` POST route to create a new reaction.
* `/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions/:reactionId` DELETE route to delete a single reaction by id.
